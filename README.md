# CSE-185-Advanced-Bioinformatics-Lab
Contains small python scripts written as a means to perform multiple different bioinformatics tasks such as :
* VarScan
* Sequence Assembly
* Generating volcano plots
* GWAS
* Analyzing ChIP-Seq data
* Dimensionality redcution on scRNA-Seq data

Most of these tasks were run using existing tools in the command line such as plink for GWAS, so must of the code or documents provided are analysis or visual representation of the data.
